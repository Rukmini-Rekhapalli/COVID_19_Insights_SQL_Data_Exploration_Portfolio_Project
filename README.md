# Covid-19 Data Exploration Project
## Overview 
This project is a data exploration and analysis project focusing on covid-19 data. It involves using 
SQL Server to import data from Excel files obtained from the our world in Data website.
The primary objectives of this project include exploring COVID_19 related datasets, createng sql views, and performing data analysis to derive insights form the data
## Data source
The  data for this project was source from [our world in data](http://ourworldindata.org)

## TOOLS Used
 SQL Server for data import ,storage , and analysis.
 Excel files obtained from our world in Data for raw data.
 SQL queries for data manipulation and analysis.
 ## Project Structure
 The project is organized as follows:
 **Data Import**: Raw data was obtained from our world in Data in Excel format.SQL Server was used to import  these datasets fro further analysis
 **Data Exploration**: SQL queries weree employed to explore the datesets,Data cleaning ,transformation,and the creation of SQL views  were part of this phase.
 **Data Analysis**: Various data analysis techniques were applied to derive meaningful insights form the COVID-19 data. This includes trend analysis,correlation studies, and other relavant  statistical analysis.
